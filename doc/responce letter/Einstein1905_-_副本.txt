\textbf{Comments to the Authors:}

\noindent This paper proposes a solution that integrates Reflecting Intelligent Surface (RIS), Terahertz (THz), and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technologies to optimize the quality of service (QoE) for users in VR wireless networks. Specifically, the solution proposes an Alternative Optimization (AO) method and a rendering capacity method based on user-attention-object to jointly optimize the passive beamforming matrix at the RIS, the transmit power among the VR users, and the rendering capacity resource to maximize the QoE.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for your insightful comments. In the revised manuscript, we should do a more detailed description of the system model for the VR scenario.

\textcolor{blue}{Fig. 2 illustrates an indoor VR scenario for providing virtual games, meetings, and travel. To satisfy the requirements of low latency and high data rate, we focus on deploying multiple RISs at the wall to assist the indoor wireless communication between one AP and multiple VR users. Specifically, during the downlink transmission, the AP transmits various types of data (graphics, sound, and visual) to the VR device via RISs, enabling immersive visual, auditory, and interactive experiences. During the uplink transmission, the VR device transmits data (position, posture, and abnormal information) to the AP assisted by RISs, providing feedback on user interaction, status, and other relevant information [29]. Each RIS consists of $N$ reflective elements.
One AP with $M$ antennas is associated with a rich-resource edge computing server and several single-antenna VR users. An intelligent digital controller connects the RIS for operating phase shifts and communicates with MEC via a wired link.}
Let $\mathcal{K} = \{1, 2, \dots, K\}$, $\mathcal{L} = \{ 1, 2, \dots, L \}$, and $\mathcal{N} = \{ 1, 2, \dots, N \}$ indicate the collections of VR users, RISs, and reflective elements, respectively.

Additionally, we explained symbols in the revised manuscript as follows.

\textcolor{blue}{The Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) represents the ratio of the desired signal power to the combined interference and noise power, the SINR of $k$th VR user for the uplink transmission is given by}

Meanwhile, a similar situation prevails in the indoor environment with complicated obstacles, and line-of-sight (LoS) communication links will be obstructed by walls, furniture, etc. 
\textcolor{blue}{The LoS link refers to a wireless communication scenario where there is a direct and unobstructed line-of-sight between the AP and VR users. }

On the contrary, the Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) communications between the AP and the VR user are established by RIS.
\textcolor{blue}{The NLoS refers to a wireless communication scenario with no direct LoS between the AP and the VR user.}

Equation (5) is difficult to understand, especially regarding the differences between $\phi_{l,i}, \theta_{l,i}, \varphi_{l,i}$. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation.
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for pointing out this problem in the manuscript. We are sorry that notions $\phi_{l,i}, \theta_{l,i}, \varphi_{l,i}$ are not clear in the original manuscript. According to your comment, We have revised the manuscript as follows.

\textcolor{blue}{In the case of slow and flat Rician fading channels, the baseband signal at the AP is expressed as}

{\color{blue}
\begin{equation}
\label{up_SINR_01}
    R_k^{up} = \sqrt{p_k} \left( \sum_{l=1}^L   \sqrt{P_{loss}^{l}} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} h_{l,i}^{UR} e^{ j \phi_{l,i} } h_{l,i}^{RA } \right) \right)x_k^{up} + \mathbf{n}_k^{up}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{l,i}$ represents the phase shifts induced by $i$th reflective element of $l$th RIS. The channel are modeled as $h_{l,i}^{UR} = \alpha_{l,i} e^{ -j \theta_{l,i} }$ and $h_{l,i}^{R A} = \beta_{l,i} e^{ -j \varphi_{l,i} } $, representing the transmission from the VR user to the $i$th element of the $l$th RIS, and from $i$th element of $l$th RIS to the AP, respectively. Here, $l=1,2, \ldots, L$ and $i=1,2, \ldots, N$. Additionally, $\alpha_{l, i}$, $\beta_{l, i}$ denote the channel amplitudes of $i$th element of $l$th RIS, while $\theta_{l, i}$ and $\varphi_{l, i}$ represent the channel phase shifts from the VR user to the $i$th element of $l$th RIS and from $i$th element of $l$th RIS to the AP, respectively.} \textcolor{blue}{Therefore, \eqref{up_SINR_01} can be expressed as }

{\color{blue}
\begin{equation}
\label{up_SINR_1}
    R_k^{up} = \sqrt{p_k} \left( \sum_{l=1}^L   \sqrt{P_{loss}^{l}} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{l,i} \beta_{l,i}  e^{ j\Delta \Phi_{l,i}^{up} } \right) \right)x_k^{up} + \mathbf{n}_k^{up}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \Phi_{l,i}^{up} = \phi_{l,i} - \theta_{l,i} - \varphi_{l,i}$ represents the phase difference term. Therefore, the instantaneous SINR at the AP is expressed as }

\begin{equation}
\label{up_SINR_2}
    R_k^{up} = \frac{ {\left| \sum_{l=1}^L \sqrt{P_{loss}^{l}} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{l,i} \beta_{l,i}  e^{j\Delta \Phi_{l,i}^{up}} \right) \right|} ^2 p_k }{N_0}

Here, $\Theta_n^{up} \in \mathcal{C} \triangleq {\left\{ {\rm exp} \left( \frac{j2 \pi m}{2^c} \right) \right\}}_{m=0}^{m=2^{c-1}}$ represents the set of available phase shift values for the reflective elements, where $m$ is the phase shift index and $c$ denotes the phase resolution in bits [31].

Why does this paper adopt a two-stage optimization method? And what are the differences between the proposed method and existing works that use a single-stage optimization method?
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. In the manuscript, we aim to maximize the QoE among VR users regarding objective and subjective factors by jointly optimizing the passive beamforming at RISs in uplink/downlink, the transmit power allocation among virtual objects, and the rendering capacity allocation. To solve this problem, we decompose the optimization problem into two stages: stage-1 aims to minimize uplink BER and maximize downlink data rate, while stage-2 aims to maximize rendering resource allocation among virtual objects. 
The single-stage method is significantly limited compared to the two-stage method, as it cannot simultaneously optimize multiple variables to enhance system performance. In the manuscript, simulations demonstrate that the two-stage method outperforms other typical single-stage methods, including \textsl{\texttt{No-Passive}}, \textsl{\texttt{No-power}}, and \textsl{\texttt{No-Rendering}} in terms of performance. 

Furthermore, methods of existing works [15] and [19] have mainly focused on optimizing the objective experience of VR users while neglecting the subjective experience. For example, in [15], the delay and reliability of VR services in THz cellular networks were explored, and the end-to-end (E2E) delay expression was derived to demonstrate that VR services achieve higher reliability and data rate by providing high bandwidth and balancing the proximity of the user to the small base station (SBS). In [19], a two-tandem queue method was applied to derive the expression and probability distribution function (PDF) of the E2E delay and reliability in THz networks, which showed that increasing the bandwidth in indoor areas improves the reliability of the VR user's experience. However, our proposed method in this paper aims to leverage a promising RIS technology to enhance the QoE of VR users in terms of objective and subjective perspectives. Therefore, within the framework of the proposed model, a two-stage approach is more suitable.

We have described the advantages of the two-stage method in the manuscript.

\textcolor{blue}{In contrast to other approaches, our proposed method quantifies the QoE among VR users from objective and subjective perspectives while jointly optimizing multiple variables to enhance the performance of the system.}


Thank you once again for your careful review and professional comments, We believe these modifications will significantly enhance the quality and impact of our paper.

\section{Reviewer \#2}
\textbf{Comments to the Authors:}

\noindent This paper focuses on optimizing the QoE for multiple users in indoor environments using a multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted THz wireless VR communication system. The paper proposes a two-stage optimization workflow to address challenges such as signal attenuation and interaction delays.

The paper considers three key performance indicators without justification. Why these three and are they representative?
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for your insightful suggestions. An important insight is that most VR services are user-oriented, which prompts us to explore how to design user-centric VR systems [36]. The QoE, as a significant performance indicator, is used to measure user experience from a subjective and objective perspective and is required to satisfy high data rate, low delay, and high reliability in the wireless VR system [11]. 

This paper considers the uplink Bit Error Rate (BER) and downlink data rate as objective performance indicators that impact the interaction between virtual elements and the natural world in VR services. In general, VR interaction latency comprises uplink transmission latency, MEC rendering latency, and downlink transmission latency. However, since the Field of View (FoV) size remains constant for different viewpoints, rendering latency remains consistent. Additionally, uplink transmission data is small, resulting in negligible uplink transmission latency. In contrast, the uplink data BER significantly affects the performance of VR systems. Moreover, VR users' subjective experience, like sickness, is a considerably important indicator [37]. Therefore, we choose the representative subjective experience of users, downlink transmission rate, and uplink BER to indicate QoE. 

In the revised manuscript, we provide a more detailed explanation for selecting three indicators.

\textcolor{blue}{An important insight is that VR services are predominantly user-oriented, prompting the exploration of designing user-centric VR systems [36]. The BER and downlink data rate are objective performance indicators impacting the interaction between virtual elements and the natural world in VR services. Meanwhile, VR users' subjective experience is a considerably important indicator [37]. Therefore, this paper focuses on three key performance indicators to formulate the QoE in VR systems, i.e., the uplink BER $P_e^{k}$, the downlink data transmission rate $R_k$, and the user's subjective experience $S_k$.}

Metaverse service is first mentioned in the problem formulation. It should be introduced in the first section of the paper.
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for pointing out this problem. We wholeheartedly agree with your suggestion. To better understand the system model in this paper, we uniformly replace the metaverse service with the VR service. In the revision, we modify the content about the metaverse service.

\textcolor{blue}{In VR services, three meaningful feelings, namely the feeling of presence (i.e., resolution, frame rate, refresh rate), the feeling of interaction (i.e., tracking sensor, operation delay, response time), and the feeling of pleasure (i.e., cybersickness, scenery, sensory mismatch), are key service indicators associated with VR performance.}

\textcolor{blue}{As objective performance indicators, the uplink BER and downlink data transmission rate affect the interaction between the virtual elements and the natural world. However, users' subjective experience becomes the primary performance indicator in VR services. Unlike traditional ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC), the focus shifts to users' subjective perceptions. Therefore, this paper investigates users' subjective perceptions determined by the rendering quality.} 

\textcolor{blue}{To effectively reflect the user's subjective experience within the VR service, the Weber-Fechner Law is employed to deduce the subjective feelings of the user.}

From (23), \textcolor{blue}{it is evident that higher transmission rates, lower BER, and a comfortable subjective experience lead to an improved QoE for VR users.} 

\textcolor{blue}{Specifically, the QoE is maximized by jointly optimizing the passive beamforming vectors at uplink/downlink transmission, the transmit power allocation for users, and rendering capacity allocation among all the virtual objects.}

\textcolor{blue}{This observation highlights that an optimization algorithm based on user-object-attention can enhance the user experience in VR services.}

To get the average uplink BER, the generic BER expression of for binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signaling is considered. Why? The uplink signal is modulated by BPSK?
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for your valuable comments. We appreciate your time and effort in reading and evaluating our work. In this manuscript, we consider the generic BER expression for BPSK signaling, mainly because simulation is performed using BPSK. In the simulation, we do a detailed explanation.

\textcolor{blue}{Firstly, we evaluate the effectiveness of RIS in reducing the uplink BER for indoor THz wireless VR systems, where BPSK is employed.} Fig. 4 shows that all cases exhibit the same trend, whereby BER performance decreases with increasing SNR.

The paper discusses a bit on MEC rendering and it proposes to allocate edge server rendering resources based on VR user-object-attention. Please explain user-object-attention and how exactly the edge server is allocated. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for your thoughtful suggestions. In the manuscript, the user-object-attention value is the dataset, referred to as attention-aware in [36]. Existing datasets used in VR research primarily focus on images and videos. However, they have several limitations: 1) Not all images suit customized services. 2) Observers do not view all images individually (i.e., they are grouped to view different sets of images);  3) Segmentation labels are manually annotated, resulting in multiple labels for one object. To address these drawbacks, [36] developed a user-object-attention dataset. The process involves image data preprocessing, object segmentation labels using K-Net, scene grouping using the KNN algorithm, and attention value calculation to identify the objects of user interest. Subsequently, more rendering resources will be allocated to the objects the user is interested in, as shown in Algorithm \ref{alg3}. In the revised manuscript, we provide a detailed explanation of user-object-attention values and the resource allocation of edge servers.

In this paper, we propose a rendering resource allocation algorithm that leverages user-object-attention values obtained from the attention-aware dataset [36] to enhance rendering capabilities and optimize computing resources. The process of obtaining the user-object-attention dataset involves image data preprocessing, virtual object segmentation labels, scene grouping, and attention value calculation. We find that users demonstrate varying attention values towards different virtual objects during the VR service experience. Objects that capture higher attention values, indicated by longer eyeball fixation times, are allocated more rendering resources.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for carefully reviewing our manuscript and requesting further clarification. In the manuscript, we focus on maximizing the QoE by optimizing multiple variables when the VR users are stationary. Furthermore, user mobility has little impact on system performance since we can re-optimize the phase shifts, transmission power, rendering capacity allocation, etc., to maximize QoE when the users are in motion. We do a detailed description in the revision.

Would it be possible to use adaptive methods from DNN to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem? What are the advantages of the proposed decomposition algorithms?
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for your valuable comments. DNN (Deep Neural Network) comprises an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each hidden layer consists of multiple interconnected neuron nodes utilizing weight parameters. Nonlinear transformations are applied to the output of nodes in the previous layer using activation functions. By leveraging multiple hidden layers, DNN can learn and extract high-level features, resulting in predictions at the output layer. DNN excels in automatically discovering and learning complex patterns and features within input data. However, DNN also presents several challenges and limitations. Firstly, training DNN typically requires significant labeled data and computing resources. Secondly, the complexity of DNN models leads to large parameter space, increasing the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the training process of DNNs is time-consuming and sensitive to initial parameter selection and hyperparameter tuning. In the manuscript, as we do not acquire RIS for our study, the DNN method is unsuitable for training small-scale experimental data. However, in the future, upon acquiring RIS, we will obtain a significant volume of data in the real world. This will enable the utilization of DNN algorithms for solving optimization problems.

Furthermore, methods of existing works [15] and [19] have mainly focused on optimizing the objective experience of VR users while neglecting the subjective experience. For example, in [15], the delay and reliability of VR services in THz cellular networks were explored, and the end-to-end (E2E) delay expression was derived to demonstrate that VR services achieve higher reliability and data rate by providing high bandwidth and balancing the proximity of the user to the small base station (SBS). In [19], a two-tandem queue method was applied to derive the expression and probability distribution function (PDF) of the E2E delay and reliability in THz networks, which showed that increasing the bandwidth in indoor areas improves the reliability of the VR user's experience. However, our proposed method in this paper aims to leverage a promising RIS technology to enhance the QoE of VR users in terms of objective and subjective perspectives. Therefore, within the framework of the proposed model, a two-stage approach is more suitable.

We have described the advantages of the proposed decomposition algorithm in the manuscript.

\textcolor{blue}{In contrast to other approaches, our proposed method quantifies the QoE among VR users from objective and subjective perspectives while jointly optimizing multiple variables to enhance the performance of the system.}

\textcolor{blue}{Fig. 2 illustrates an indoor VR scenario for providing virtual games, meetings, and travel. To satisfy the requirements of low latency and high data rate, we focus on deploying multiple RISs at the wall to assist the indoor wireless communication between one AP and multiple VR users. Specifically, during the downlink transmission, the AP transmits various types of data (graphics, sound, and visual) to the VR device via RISs, enabling immersive visual, auditory, and interactive experiences. During the uplink transmission, the VR device transmits data (position, posture, and abnormal information) to the AP assisted by RISs, providing feedback on user interaction, status, and other relevant information [29]. Each RIS consists of $N$ reflective elements.
One AP with $M$ antennas is associated with a rich-resource edge computing server and several single-antenna VR users. An intelligent digital controller connects the RIS for operating phase shifts and communicates with MEC via a wired link.}

To fill the aforementioned research gaps, this paper aims to optimize the QoE for multiple users in the indoor environment with multi-RIS-assisted THz wireless VR communication systems. To achieve this, the following questions must be solved:

\textcolor{blue}{
\begin{enumerate}
\item How to design and implement the QoE maximization algorithm in a multi-RIS-assisted VR wireless network?
\item How to quantify the QoE from objective and subjective perspectives?
\item How to model the uplink and downlink transmissions channel in multi-RIS VR Terahertz networks?
\end{enumerate}}

\textcolor{blue}{In this paper, our investigation focuses on VR systems in the THz networks, RIS-assisted wireless networks, and VR implemented in RIS-assisted THz networks, as depicted in Fig. \ref{structure}. Furthermore, the integration of VR and RIS is vital for enhancing the VR user experience, given the tremendous potential of both technologies. From the perspective of VR users, achieving optimal objective performance and subjective experience is crucial. To address this, we propose an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm that simultaneously optimizes the phase shifts of reflective elements at the RIS side, the transmission power allocation for users, and the BER, while considering rendering capability based on user-object-attention values. The primary contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.}

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent Thank you for your valuable comments on our manuscript. In response, we have incorporated additional references in the revised version.

\textcolor{blue}{In [14], the authors introduced a MEC-assisted wireless VR system, which employs the RNN approach to predict the Field of View (FoV) for each VR user in a real-time manner. Additionally, the rendering data is offloaded from the VR device to the MEC for processing, and the DRL method is employed to optimize the long-term QoE for the VR user.}

\textcolor{blue}{In [18], the authors proposed a low-latency VR system assisted by UAV-BS, where the VR data is processed either at the UAV-BS or at the users before transmission, and an iterative algorithm with low complexity is introduced to minimize the maximum communication and computation delays for all VR users.}

There are some grammatical mistakes in this paper. For example, In Section II Related Work, “presented a THz wireless VR network by RIS-assisted…” should be “presented a RIS-assisted THz wireless VR network...”, and so on.

\textbf{Response:}

\noindent We apologize for the poor language of our manuscript. We worked on the manuscript for a long time, and the repeated addition and removal of sentences and sections obviously led to poor readability. We have now worked on both language and readability for language corrections. We really hope that the flow and language level have been substantially improved.

Thank you once again for your insightful comments. We believe these modifications will significantly enhance the quality and impact of our paper.
